## Senior Graphics Software Engineer
### [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/snapdragon) — San Diego, CA
#### 2021 - Present
##### *Infrastructure, Automation, Sandbox, Orchestration, Distributed Systems, Reporting; Python, Shell, FastAPI, Redis, RabbitMQ, Artifactory, LSF*
- Designed a large-scale framework to automate pre-silicon testing efforts for upcoming `[Snapdragon GPUs](https://www.qualcomm.com/snapdragon)`.
- Developed an in-house test execution framework from the ground up to run various test suites on new GPU drivers, including `Vulkan`, `OpenCL`, and `OpenGL` Conformance Tests.
- Devised various utility functions for dispatching jobs and reporting results using `Python`, `RabbitMQ` messaging queues, and the `Redis` database.
- Developed continuous integration/delivery (`CI/CD`) pipelines to dispatch jobs on high-performance servers using `Jenkins`.
- Utilized containerization technologies such as `Docker` and `Google Kubernetes Engine` (GKE) to deploy services on Google Cloud Platform.
- Created a utility to resolve frequent build blockages by terminating hung processes and filesystem locks, significantly increasing the productivity of hundreds of graphics software engineers.
- Promoted to Senior Graphics Software Engineer in 2024.
- Worked across three different offices (Boulder, CO; San Diego, CA; and Toronto, Canada) during a five-year tenure.
