Senior Infrastructure Software Engineer with `5+ years` building `distributed automation systems`, high-performance `API backends`, and developer tools at scale. At Qualcomm, I `architected and own` the Adreno drivers validation platform `running 200K+ tests/week` across next-gen `Snapdragon GPUs` - from containerized orchestration to async pipelines and real-time reporting `handling 2M+ rows/month`. Currently building `MCP servers` for LLM-accessible infrastructure. Prior `ML research` in `GANs` and `speech processing`. Driven by building reliable, delightful tools that create lasting impact.
