### [Danger Room Protocol: Phoenix — Advanced Combat Simulation](#)

##### *Holographics, Spatial Reasoning, Real-Time Combat Analysis; Ruby-Quartz, Cerebro Core*

- Designed an `immersive 3D` combat training program for student units using `holographic projection` and spatial APIs.
- Implemented `spatial gestures` for real-time environment modification, allowing for `dynamic battlefield adaptation` during training.
- Developed `simulation mechanics` with axial rotation and orbit logic to simulate `Space-level combat` and gravity-defying scenarios.
- Integrated `Cerebro-link` alpha SDKs to enable seamless transitions between `simulated` and `augmented` reality training modules.

### [Blackbird Avionics — Next-Gen Jet Flight Control](#)
##### *Avionics, Stealth Tech, Telepathic Integration; Python, C++, ROS*
- Developed an `end-to-end flight control pipeline` for the `SR-71 Blackbird` reconnaissance jet.
- Scaled `telepathic interface` processing on `Cerebro EMR`, reducing latency between pilot intent and jet response by `~85%`.
- Architected a custom `PaddedBatchGenerator` with `Masking layers` to handle variable-length signal data from onboard sensors.

### [Optic-Vison Control System — Precision Energy Discharge](#)
##### *Optics, Ruby-Quartz Engineering, Materials Science*
- Engineered a high-precision `energy-control visor` using custom-cut `Ruby-Quartz lenses` for `discrete` power management.
- Developed a `pressure-sensitive firing mechanism` to enable variable intensity of energy discharges, from `precision slicing` to `wide-field concussions`.
- Conducted exhaustive `stress tests` on visor frames to ensure durability during `Omega-level` energy output.
